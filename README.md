# PatternUnmixer

PatternUnmixer (formerly called PUnmix) learns a model of fundamental subcellular patterns using user-specified images of "pure" subcellular patterns (e.g., lysosomes, endosomes) and then uses that model to calculate the fraction of probe in each subcellular compartment for images containing mixed patterns. It implements the approach described in
